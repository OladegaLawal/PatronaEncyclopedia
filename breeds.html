        <h5>Description</h5>

        The Afghan Hound is a hound that is distinguished by its thick, fine, silky coat and its tail with a ring curl at the end. The breed is selectively bred for its unique features in the cold mountains of Afghanistan. Its local name is Tāžī Spay (Pashto: تاژي سپی‎) or Sag-e Tāzī (Dari: سگ تازی‎). Other names for this breed are Tāzī, Balkh Hound, Baluchi Hound, Barakzai Hound, Shalgar Hound, Kabul Hound, Galanday Hound or sometimes incorrectly African Hound. They have the ability to run and turn well.

The Afghan Hound is tall, standing in height 61–74 cm (24–29 in) and weighing 20–27 kg (44–60 lb). The coat may be any colour, but white markings, particularly on the head, are discouraged.
<h5>Life Span</h5>
In various surveys conducted within the UK, Afghan Hounds were shown to have an average lifespan of about 12 years, similar to other breeds of their size. In the 2004 UK Kennel Club survey, the most common causes of death were cancer (31%), old age (20%), cardiac (10.5%), and urologic (5%). Those that died of old age had a median lifespan of 12 years, with 12% living to at least 14.
<h5>Health Concern</h5>
Major health issues are allergies, cancer, and hip dysplasia (not typical of bakhmulls). Sensitivity to anesthesia is an issue the Afghan Hound shares with the rest of the sighthound group, as sighthounds have relatively low levels of body fat. Afghan Hounds are also among the dog breeds most likely to develop chylothorax, a rare condition which causes the thoracic ducts to leak, allowing large quantities of chyle fluid to enter the dog's chest cavity.This condition commonly results in a lung-lobe torsion (in which the dog's lung twists within the chest cavity, requiring emergency surgery), due to the breed's typically deep, "barrel"-shaped chest. If not corrected through surgery, chylothorax can ultimately cause fibrosing pleuritis, or a hardening of the organs, due to scar tissue forming around the organs to protect them from the chyle fluid. Chylothorax is not necessarily, but often proves to be, fatal.

        <h5>Description</h5>

        The Kuchi (or Afghan, Pashtun call them "Ghiljak" or "Kucchi") Shepherd is an Afghan livestock guardian dog, taking its name from the Kuchi people of Afghanistan.[1] It is a working dog following the nomads, protecting caravans and flocks of sheep, goats, camels and other livestock from wolves, big cats and thieves. It is sometimes known as just a local variant of the Central Asian Shepherd Dog and its status as a distinct breed is disputable.

        The Afghan Kucchi is usually brindle grey and dark black stripes.
        The Kuchi dog breed possesses a very rich gene pool and the dogs adapt well to varying environments. It also means that gene expression can vary greatly from one individual to another. For that reason, it is often difficult for an unaccustomed observer to determine what makes a particular dog a true Kuchi dog, or what type of a Kuchi dog it is.

        In general, the Kuchi dog is large, often giant dogs, with a coat that can be short, medium, or long, backed by thick underwool. They vary in height, reaching from 23 to 26 inches (58 to 66 cm) at the withers for the females and from 24 to 29 inches (61 to 74 cm) and more for the males. Their weight ranges from about 84 to 120 pounds (38 to 54 kg) for the female dogs and from 88 to 176 pounds (40 to 80 kg) and more for the male dogs.


<h5>Types</h5>
The Kuchi dogs can roughly be divided into three types: the mountain-type, the steppe-type, and the desert-type.

The mountain-type dogs form a very large-boned, heavy-coated variety that is well suited to living in the mountainous regions of the Pamir range. They are usually found at higher elevations, where there are greater humidity and more extreme, cool temperatures.
The steppe-type dogs are of much lighter build, with medium to long hair. They are faster and more agile on expansive flats than the mountain variety. They can be characterized as having a mastiff-like build combined with a sighthound appearance.[clarification needed]
The desert-type dogs represent a variant most often found in the large desert flatlands, with little vegetation and a hotter climate. They are of medium height, with a short to medium-length coat backed by very thick underwool during the cold season. They can possess characteristics of both of the other types, especially when it comes to the head structure.
Another way to classify the Kuchi dog could be according to a lion-type (Djence Sheri), or a tiger-type (Djence Palangi). This division applies mostly to the desert-type dogs, but it is important to keep in mind that each of the regional variants can display characteristics found in other types as well.

The lion-type dogs are of heavier build, with larger heads and deeper chests. Their coat is usually thicker and they are of medium height with a larger, bear-type head.
The tiger-type dogs are the more athletic-looking, with a long and deep habitus, brick- or wedge-shaped head and shorter coat. They are more often linked with steppe-type dogs.

        <h5>Description</h5>
        The Indian pariah dog, also known as the Indian native dog or INDog,[6][7] South Asian pye dog and Desi Dog,[4][6] is a landrace of dog native to the Indian subcontinent.[5] They have erect ears, a wedge-shaped head, and a curved tail. It is easily trainable and often used as a guard dog and police dog.[8][9] This dog is an example of an ancient group of dogs known as pye-dogs. It is possible that the ancestors of this dog dates back 4,500 years ago.[10]
<h5>Appearance</h5>
It is a medium-sized dog of square to slightly rectangular build and short coat. The dog has a double coat, a coarse upper coat, and a soft undercoat. The most commonly observed colours are browns, ranging from dark to reddish-brown, with or without white markings. Solid blacks are rare, but some dogs are pied. Shaded coats, brindles, solid white and dalmatian-type spotting are never seen in pure populations. These may be a sign of mixing with modern breeds, as they are only seen in dogs in cities and other sites where non-native dogs have been introduced.

<h5>Health</h5>

Being a naturally evolved breed, they have very few health concerns and thrive with minimal maintenance in suitable climates.[9] The skin needs very little grooming and the dogs themselves are relatively clean.[9] They have little body odour.[4][9] Genetic health ailments like hip dysplasia are extremely rare, since there is no inbreeding and the dominant genes that aid their survival are naturally selected over time.[9] Most of their deaths occur due to accidents on the roads and railway tracks, not getting food or drinking polluted water, tumors in the body, getting bit by snakes or harmed by humans.

        <h5>Description</h5>
        Pampas Deerhound (Portuguese: Veadeiro pampeano) is a Brazilian breed of hunting dog; it is also found in Argentina and Uruguay. It is common in Brazil, where it was first recognized by a national kennel club.[1] The dogs were used to track, capture, and hunt deer (pampas deer), and thus earned the name Pampas Deerhound (in Brazilian Portuguese "Veadeiro pampeano": veadeiro = deer-hound; pampeano = those who came from the pampas). It is still a widely preferred hunting companion to track other animals, such as wild boars.
        <h5>Appearance</h5>
        Medium-sized and long-legged with good muscles (denoting strength and hardiness), this dog breed is slender without seeming very thin and is physiologically built for speed.[3] The tail is carried low, with a length that does not exceed the hocks. Some dogs may have a small fringe towards the lower part of the tail.

The nose may be black, brown or liver colored, and the muzzle is the same length as the skull, with a not-too-marked stop. Its ears are pointed, bent backward (rose ears) and erect when alert. The eyes are greenish or hazel colored and could take on varying shades.[5]

        <h5>Description</h5>
        The Australian Cattle Dog (ACD), or simply Cattle Dog, is a breed of herding dog originally developed in Australia for droving cattle over long distances across rough terrain. This breed is a medium-sized, short-coated dog that occurs in two main colour forms. It has either brown or black hair distributed fairly evenly through a white coat, which gives the appearance of a "red" or "blue" dog.
        <h5>Appearance</h5>
        The Australian Cattle Dog is a sturdy, muscular, compact dog that gives the impression of agility and strength. It has a broad skull that flattens to a definite stop between the eyes, with muscular cheeks and a medium-length, deep, powerful muzzle. The ears are pricked, small to medium in size and set wide apart, with a covering of hair on the inside. The eyes are oval and dark, with an alert, keen expression. The neck and shoulders are strong and muscular; the forelegs are straight and parallel; and the feet round and arched, with small, sturdy toes and nails.[1]

        The Australian Cattle Dog breed standard states that it should have well-conditioned muscles, even when bred for companion or show purposes, and that its appearance should be symmetrical and balanced, with no individual part of the dog exaggerated. It should not look either delicate or cumbersome, as either characteristic limits the agility and endurance that is necessary for a working dog.
        <h5>Size</h5>
        The female Australian Cattle Dog measures approximately 43–48 centimetres (17–19 in) at the withers, and the male measures about 46–51 centimetres (18–20 in) at the withers. The dog should be longer than tall, that is, the length of the body from breast bone to buttocks is greater than the height at the withers, in a ratio of 10 to 9.[1] An Australian Cattle Dog in good condition weighs around 18–25 kilograms (40–55 lb).

           <h5>Description</h5>
           The Australian Kelpie, or simply Kelpie, is an Australian sheep dog successful at mustering and droving with little or no guidance. It is a medium-sized dog and comes in a variety of colours. The Kelpie has been exported throughout the world and is used to muster livestock, primarily sheep, cattle and goats.

           The breed has been separated into two distinct varieties: the Show (or Bench) Kelpie and the Working Kelpie.[2] The Show Kelpie is seen at conformation dog shows in some countries and is selected for appearance rather than working instinct, while the Working Kelpie is bred for working ability rather than appearance.
           <h5>Appearance</h5>
           The Kelpie is a soft-coated, medium-sized dog, generally with prick ears and an athletic appearance. Coat colours include black, black and tan, red, red and tan, blue, blue and tan, fawn, fawn and tan, cream, black and blue, and white and gold. The Kelpie generally weighs 14–20 kg (31–44 lb) and measures 41–51 cm (16–20 in) at the withers. They can reach maximum weight of 25–27 kgs

           <h5>Description</h5>
           The Australian Silky Terrier or simply Silky Terrier (depending on the breed registry) is a small breed of dog of the terrier dog type. The breed was developed in Australia, although the ancestral types and breeds were from Great Britain. It is closely related to the Australian Terrier and the Yorkshire Terrier. The breed is called the Silky Terrier in North America, but is called the Australian Silky Terrier in its country of origin and in the rest of the world.
           <h5>Appearance</h5>
           The Australian Silky Terrier is a small and compact short-legged terrier, 23 to 26 cm (9.1 to 10.2 in) at the withers, alert and active. The long silky grey and white or blue and tan coat is an identifying feature, hanging straight and parted along the back, and described as "flat, fine and glossy".[1] All proportions and aspects of the body and head as well as desirable shades of grey and white and placement of markings are extensively described in the breed standard.[2]

           The Silky Terrier should be slightly longer than tall (about one fifth longer than the height at withers). This is a dog that was historically used for hunting and killing rodents and snakes, so its body should have enough substance to fit this role. The coat requires quite a lot of regular grooming and shampooing to retain its silkiness.
           
           The Silky Terrier has a strong, wedge-shaped head. The eyes are small and almond-shaped. According to the standards, light-colored eyes are considered a fault. The ears are small and carried erect. The Silky Terrier has a high-set tail and small, almost catlike, feet. The coat should be long, but not so long to approach floor length. The hair on the face and ears is normally cut.

           <h5>Description</h5>
           The Heeler is a naturally bobtailed or tailless, medium-sized cattle dog similar and/or related to the Australian Cattle Dog (aka, "Queensland Heeler"). The Australian Stumpy Tail Cattle Dog was developed in Australia[1] to herd cattle,[2] and descends from crosses between European herding dogs and the Australian dingo. The name is spelled both with hyphenation, Blue Heeler,[2] and without,[3] and the shorter name Heeler is also sometimes applied.
           <h5>Appearance</h5>
           The Heeler is a normally proportioned, rugged dog with pricked (standing up) ears and long legs. The breed's most distinctive feature, for which the breed is named, is the frequent lack of a tail. When there is a tail, it is quite short, no longer than 10 cm (4 in.), and undocked.[3] The coat is medium length to short, straight, dense and harsh. The coat color is a speckled red or speckled blue. Heelers do not show brown points or markings as seen on the ACD. Height is [10] 46–51 centimetres (18–20 in) at the withers for dogs, with bitches being slightly smaller. Blue Heelers (a.k.a. "Queensland Heeler") (with a long tail) is similar in appearance to the Heeler, but the Australian Cattle Dog is proportionally heavier, less leggy and has brown points and markings.[clarification needed](See the article Dog terminology for an explanation of terms.)

           <h5>Description</h5>
           The Bull Arab is a type of dog developed in Australia for pig hunting.[2][1][3] The dog was developed from crossing large, strong dogs of which the most common were Bull Terriers, Great Danes, Greyhounds, and Mastiffs.[2] The result was a medium to large size, short-haired, muscular dog.[2]

           The Bull Arab was originally bred for feral pig hunting, and developed to locate pigs, pull them to the ground, and hold them by the ear.[4] The breed is able to locate feral pigs as far as 4–6 kilometres (2.5–3.7 mi) away by smell.[1]
           <h5>Temperament</h5>
           Bull Arabs have a calm temperament, are highly intelligent[5][6] and easily trainable,[6] and are known for their loyalty and their love of people.[5]

           The breed has a reputation for aggression[7] which according to RSPCA Australia is due to the media and public perception.[8] Attacks on people in several states of Australia have been attributed to the breed,[9][10] although according to the Mackay Regional Council proportionally in no greater numbers than other dog breeds.[11] Attacks on livestock including the killing of a number of sheep and other animals have been attributed to Bull Arabs that had escaped their owners and/or confinement.[12][13][14][15][16] It has been stated that there is a little hard data to support the breed's reputation for aggression and the perception problems are caused by the people who own the dogs and a lack of socialisation.[11]
           
           The breed is cited as being used for companion and therapy animals.[17][18]

           <h5>Description</h5>
           The Halls Heeler was a dog bred by Thomas Simpson Hall to herd cattle on the Hall family's extensive properties in northwestern New South Wales in the 19th century. On Dartbrook Station, in the Upper Hunter Valley, Hall selectively crossed the offspring of Northumberland Drover's Dogs (Border Collie lineage) that he had imported, with the progeny of dingoes that he had tamed. By 1840 he had bred the type of dog that he needed to control cattle on the massive runs that his family owned, and until he died in 1870 few of these dogs were owned and used by anyone outside the Hall family and their workers.[1] However the death of Thomas Hall and the break-up of the Hall estate coincided with the development of the dog show, and an interest in breeding dogs to specific criteria or standards. The Halls Heeler was further developed into two contemporary dog breeds, the Australian Cattle Dog and the Australian Stumpy Tail Cattle Dog.[1] The name is spelled both with the possessive apostrophe, as Hall's Heeler, and without.
           <h5>Temperament</h5>
           While dogs were not routinely bred for consistent appearance before the end of the 19th century, the Halls Heeler was described as a thick-set dingo, usually speckled blue or red in appearance.[1]

           <h5>Description</h5>
           The kangaroo dog or kangaroo hound is an Australian type of sighthound purposely crossbred from a variety of sighthound breeds to produce a hunting dog.

           Kangaroo dogs were first bred by colonial settlers in Australia from as early as the 1830s, the aim being to create a sighthound fast, strong and robust enough to outrun, catch and hold a kangaroo without being injured or disembowelled by the animal's powerful, clawed hind legs.[1][2][3] From the 1830s onward, colonial hunting clubs were established across Australia's colonies, with native kangaroos, wallabies or dingoes pursued by mounted hunters and their kangaroo dogs.[1][4] Originally, these dogs were bred from British sighthound breeds, principally the Greyhound and Scottish Deerhound, with occasional Irish Wolfhound blood; later, the Borzoi was also used, whilst more recently the Saluki was added as well.[1][2][3][5]
           
           Hunting of native species with sighthounds is now banned in Australia; however, kangaroo dogs are still bred for hunting invasive introduced species, such as feral pigs and red foxes.

Koolie
Pete may01 web.JPG
A short-coat blue-merle Koolie
Other names	Australian Koolie - German Koolie - Coulie - German Collie
Origin	Australia
Breed status	Not recognized as a breed by any major kennel club.
Notes	Australian Koolies have been recognized on the Australian Sporting Registrar, the American Herding Breed Association's Registrar, the New Zealands Obedience Registrar and the Finland Herding Association. Koolies registered with the Koolie Club of Australia are accepted to the Canine Control Sporting registers in Victoria, New South Wales and Queensland.
Dog (domestic dog)
The Koolie (also known as the Australian Koolie or by the historic misnomer "German Coolie") is an Australian dog breed. The Koolie is a working or herding dog which has existed in Australia since the early 19th century when it was bred from imported British working dogs. Robert Kaleski, in an article on Cattle Dogs in the August 1903 issue of the Agricultural Gazette of New South Wales, describes the "Welsh heeler or merle, erroneously known as the German collie," as a "blue-gray dog about the size and build of a smooth-haired collie, generally with wall eyes." The British background predominated in the dogs that came to be associated with the "German collie" name.

There is substantial variation in the Koolie population, as Koolies were bred to exhibit different characteristics in different regions. The Koolie Club of Australia defines the breed based on its ability to work rather than on its conformation. However, most Koolie breeders refer to the Koolie as a breed rather than as a type, and assert that it "breeds true", with various types or strains.

The Koolie is a "herding dog", one which has a natural instinct to circle widely round sheep and bring them back to their owner. Koolies are known as silent, upright, working dogs. They are used for herding sheep and also for quiet careful work at close quarters at lambing time or for "shedding" (cutting out) sheep.
           <h5>Health</h5>
           The median longevity of Koolies is about 15 years, which is a typical lifespan for this breed. Koolies have a diverse but small gene pool and so can and do suffer from the many genetic problems found in recognised breeds however most have genetic tests available these days but hip and elbow scoring is necessary to reduce the incidence of Hip and Elbow Dysplasia, the merle for which the Koolie is most recognised by can, and does, produce blind and/or deaf white pups so merle testing should be performed prior to breeding, merle to solid are the safest option otherwise.

          A balanced, smoothly-muscled dog breed, the Miniature Fox Terrier has a small sized, distinctive head with erectile ears that can stand straight up or fold at the tips. Another distinguishing feature is its articulate, oval-shaped foot - a feature found in very few small breeds of dog. The breed standard has always allowed for the dog's tail to be docked or undocked, however owners need to be aware of and obey local laws in this regard. Natural bobtails are known to occur. There are only three permitted colour combinations: black & white, tan & white, and black, tan & white. The coat of the Miniature Fox Terrier is always short and fine. Weight is 3.5 to 5.5 kilograms (8 to 12 lbs) and height at the withers is 9.5 to 12.0 inches (24 cm to 30.5 cm).

          Miniature Fox Terriers are closely related to the Toy Fox Terrier, a breed that developed along similar lines in the United States. Some Toy Fox Terrier owners can trace their dogs’ pedigrees to "Foiler", the first Fox Terrier registered by the Kennel Club in Britain, circa 1875–6. Other related breeds include the Jack Russell Terrier, the Rat Terrier, and the Tenterfield Terrier.
           <h5>Health</h5>
           Miniature Fox Terriers are generally healthy and hardy despite their size. They need little maintenance; some individuals that do not run often on hard surfaces will need regular nail clipping. Luxating patellae, a common ailment among small breeds, occurs frequently among backyard bred dogs, bred by people who are not registered breeders; the Mini Foxie Club rules state that, before breeding occurs, a health declaration must be obtained from a veterinarian and that the dog must be classified and graded by the club. This rule has greatly helped to reduce the incidence of luxating patellae in the breed. Meals should always be small and nutritious; this is a small breed, with a small sized stomach. To avoid or minimise painful ailments such as arthritis, dogs need to be kept trim and athletic.

           <h5>Description</h5>
           Tenterfield terriers must be predominantly white as required by he the Breed Standard of the ANKC. They are not exaggerated in any features. They have a square or compact body, a wedge shaped head with equal length from occiput to stop and stop to the end of the nose. This gives the head parallel head planes, making the head unusual in this Group. The Tenterfield Terrier may also have semi-erect ears or pricked ears, the latter being more common. Tenterfield Terriers stand around 28 cm (11 inches) high and can come in tan and white, black and white, liver/tan/white tri-coloured or black/tan/white tri-coloured.[1] Their unique feature is their naturally occurring bob tail which can come in any length.[2]

           <h5>Health</h5>
           Despite its small stature, the dog is friendly with an outgoing, adaptable nature, bold in the way of terriers and is intelligent. The coat is low maintenance for grooming purposes. Although they can live to 20 years in good health, the average lifespan is from 12 to 14 years.

           <h5>Description</h5>
  This small dog has a slight resemblance to a Dachshund, with short legs (although longer than a dachshund's) and a long body. The coat is dense, short but smooth except for the tail and neck. The round eyes have a lively expression. Being very sturdy, the Alpine Dachsbracke is visibly robust and has a big boned structure.

  Preferred colors in competition are dark deer red with or without black hairs lightly interspersed. Black with red-brown markings on the head, chest, legs, feet, and tail are also permitted, as well as a white star on the chest (according to the American Rare Breed Association). The ideal height for dogs is 37–38 cm, and the ideal height for bitches is 36–37 cm. Strong limbs and feet, with black toenails and tight toes as well as strong elastic skin are features that judges look for in competition. They also look for a trotting gait. The top coat should be very thick, the undercoat dense and both closefitting to the body.[1]

  The Alpine Dachsbracke weighs from 15 to 18 kg (33 to 40 lb) and stands from 34 to 42 cm (13 to 16 in) at the withers. It is often compared with the dachshund, as they are very similar in appearance.

           <h5>Temperament</h5>
           Used effectively to track wounded deer, this breed could work even in harsh terrain and high altitude. It makes a good companion, although it is primarily a hunter and therefore is kept mostly by hunters. It has a fearless, friendly and intelligent personality. Most Alpine Dachsbrackes are excellent with children and good with dogs and other pets, though they may exhibit a strong prey drive typical of many scent dogs.

            <h5>Description</h5>
            Like other farm dogs raised for work rather than for pets or show, the appearance can vary a great deal, although there is a definite breed standard.[1] In general, the Austrian Pinscher is a normally proportioned strong and sturdy dog, 33 – 48 cm (13 - 19 inches) at the withers. The breed has button ears and a head described as being shaped like a pear. The double coat is short to medium long, in a variety of yellow, red or black and tan colours, usually with white markings on the face, chest, feet and tip of the tail. The long tail is held high, and dogs of this breed should look lively and alert.[2] They are heavier, more rugged and rectangular in appearance than the German Pinscher.
 
            <h5>Health</h5>
            No data have been collected on the breed's health, but good health is a stated objective of the breed restoration breeding in Austria.[7]

           <h5>Description</h5>
           The Styrian Coarse-haired Hound is a medium-sized hound, with height at the withers of 45–53 cm (17.5–21 in), and weight between 15–18 kg (33-40 lbs) with a well muscled body and a serious expression.[1]

            The breed name refers to the coat, which is harsh and rough (although not shaggy). Coat colours are red and fawn; a white mark on the chest may be present. The breed tolerates extremes of temperature well, and has remained a healthy breed through "refresher breeding" (Auffrischungszucht, outcrossing).[2]

            <h5>Description</h5>
            The Tyrolean Hound, also known as the Tyroler Bracke, is a breed of scent hound originally developed in the 1800s from the Bracke hounds and the Celtic hounds. It was first bred in Tyrol as a dog adapted to hunting in the snow.[1] Emperor Maximilian I used this hound for hunting hare and fox and for tracking wounded game. Breeding began in 1860, and then in 1896 the first standard of breeding was published. Followed shortly thereafter, the Tyrolean Hound was recognized as their own breed in 1908. It was not until 2006, that the Tyrolean Hound was recognized by the United Kennel Club.[2]

            As with dogs that come from hardworking scent hound breeds, the Tyrolean hound was bred for their hunting ability. The breed is known for their excellent ability in being able to maneuver through mountainous or heavily wooded areas, and for their amazing scenting skills. This is all made possible with the size of the Tyrolean Hound. It tends to be a medium to large dog, measuring in at about 18.5 to 24 inches tall, and weighing about 35 to 60 pounds for males. Females tend to be smaller physically, only growing to be about 16.5 to 19 inches tall, however, both have a nice flowing outline and tend to be fairly muscular. The Tyrolean Hound, whether male or female, also has a thick double coat, with a coarse undercoat, as opposed to fine. They also tend to have the 3 main colors of red, black, and tan, with patches of white mixed in between. [2]
            <h5>Health</h5>
            Tyrolean Hounds have an average life expectancy of about 12 to 14 years overall. These dogs are robust and generally healthy. They need to keep an active lifestyle and have high exercise requirements, though not hyperactive. As puppies, they should be given high-quality dry food until about 12 months when they can be transferred over to adult dry food. They can also take either active or working dog formulas, respectively with their lifestyle. When they are adults it can be necessary to keep them engaged with mental stimulation. Without such exercises or obedience training, they may lose passion in their work or other nuisance behaviors may appear. Also, with the harsh double coat that the Tyrolean Hound bares, they may need to be brushed once or two times a week along with other various health duties such as; teeth brushing, coat grooming, and a weekly ear cleaning.[7]

          The Belgian Mastiff was a large, powerful dog that stood between 69 and 78 centimetres (27 and 31 in) and weighed between 45 and 50 kilograms (99 and 110 lb).[1][2] The breed was muscular and heavy-boned with a large head and thick neck, their tails were typically docked to prevent them from being damaged whilst pulling carts.[1][2] The Belgian Mastiff's coat was short, smooth and loose fitting; they were typically fawn or brindle in colour, with dark masks and white markings also known.[1][2]

          In character, the Belgian Mastiff was described as a tireless worker with strong protective instincts; they were not known to be particularly friendly to anyone but their masters.

         <h5>Description</h5>
         The Belgian Shepherd is a medium-sized athletic breed with a body built for endurance, they typically stand between 56 and 66 centimetres (22 and 26 in) with bitches being on average 4 centimetres (1.6 in) shorter than dogs, they usually weigh between 20 and 30 kilograms (44 and 66 lb); the breed standard states the ideal height is 62 centimetres (24 in) for dogs and 58 centimetres (23 in) for bitches.[1][2][3] The breed has a long, slender head with triangular, erect ears that are rounded at the base, and a long, narrow but balanced muzzle,[2][4][5] according to the breed standard a dog that stands 62 centimetres at the withers should have a head that is 25 centimetres (9.8 in) long and a muzzle approximately half that length.[3] The breed's body is muscular but not overly heavy; the body's length from shoulder to haunches is approximately the same as their height at the withers, proportionally slightly longer in bitches; they have a straight topline and their belly is neither low-slung nor overly high like that of a sighthound.[5] The breed's chest is deep but not overly broad; their neck is muscular, widening at the shoulders with a slight arch at the nape; their tail is strong and of medium length and curves upwards slightly at the level of their knee; their forelegs are straight and well-boned, their hind legs are muscular and very powerful, none of the legs are overly heavy.[5]

         <h5>Temperament</h5>
         Belgian Shepherds are known to be highly intelligent, alert and sensitive; they are typically highly trainable, vigilant and hard-working with a strong guarding instinct making them protective of property and family, and very well suited for service with security services.[4][5][6] The Groenendael and Tervueren varieties have a reputation for occasionally being snappy, making them less suitable as companion dogs for children; the Laekenois, whilst considered very good with children, can occasionally be troublesome with other dogs.[1][2] The Belgian Shepherd responds well to training and responds very well to firm and understanding training; they require training from an early age, particularly the Laekenois which can have a tendency to try to dominate a weaker-willed master.[1][6] The breed is very active, particularly the Malinois which may reflect its continued breeding for security roles, and they all require exercise; the breed adapts well to living indoors, although the Malinois is least suited to these environs.[1][6][7]

            <h5>Description</h5>
            The Bichon Frise is a small dog that weighs approximately 5–10 kg (10–20 lbs) and stands 23–30 cm (9–12 in) at the withers, but slightly larger dogs are not uncommon. The skull is slightly rounded and the muzzle is not pointy. The tail is groomed to be long and curly and is carried over the back. It has a black nose and dark round eyes; its white hair consists of a curly, dense coat with little shedding (much like a poodle in this respect), although many of the breed do tend to have less curly hair than others. A small amount of buff, cream, or apricot colour may be seen around its ears, snout, paws or body, but normally these colours do not exceed 10% of its body. FCI/AKC Standard coat colour is pure white; other colours such as apricot or grey and brown are not recognised. A white coat is preferred in the show ring. The head and legs are proportionate in size to the body, and the ears and tail are natural (not docked or cropped).[19] The coat is trimmed often to make the hair seem like an even length. Bichon Frises have a medium-high intelligence.
            <h5>Health</h5>
            Bichon Frises are prone to scratching and chewing on themselves in the summer because of the warm and moist air, which commonly results in serious skin conditions. They are comparatively hypoallergenic, but they themselves suffer from allergies to fleas, ticks, chemicals, pollen, dust, etc. Loose knee joints, ear infections, cataracts, diabetes, and heart disease are also common.[30]

            Bichons are also prone to liver shunts. These often go undetected until later in life, leading to complications that cannot be addressed, and therefore liver failure. Bichons who are underweight, runts of the litter, or have negative reactions to foods high in protein are more likely to be suffering from a shunt. When detected early, shunt often can be corrected through surgery. However, the later in life the shunt is detected, the lower the likelihood of surgery being successful. Shunts can be kept under control through special low-protein diets and through medications to support liver function, help flush toxins that build up in the kidneys and liver, and control seizures that often occur as a symptom of the shunt. Without surgery, Bichons with shunts on average live to be 4–6 years old. Other symptoms include dark urine, lethargy, loss of appetite, and increased thirst. Seizures come in all forms; episodes of seizures can begin early in life but may go undetected. Early seizures can appear as a hypnotic state or an episode of vertigo.

            <h5>Description</h5>
            Bloodhounds weigh from 36 to 72 kg (80 to 160 lbs). They are 58 to 69 cm (23 to 27 inches) tall at the withers. According to the AKC standard for the breed, larger dogs are preferred by conformation judges. Acceptable colors for Bloodhounds are black, liver, and red. Bloodhounds possess an unusually large skeletal structure with most of their weight concentrated in their bones, which are very thick for their length. The coat, typical for a scent hound, is hard and composed of fur alone, with no admixture of hair.
            <h5>Health</h5>
            Compared to other purebred dogs, Bloodhounds suffer an unusually high rate of gastrointestinal ailments, with gastric dilatation volvulus (bloat) being the most common type of gastrointestinal problem.[4] The breed also suffers an unusually high incidence of eye, skin, and ear ailments;[4] thus these areas should be inspected frequently for signs of developing problems. Owners should be especially aware of the signs of bloat, which is both the most common illness and the leading cause of death of Bloodhounds. The thick coat gives the breed the tendency to overheat quickly.

          <h5>Description</h5>
          The Bouvier is a powerfully built, compact, rough-coated dog of rugged appearance. It gives the impression of size and strength without clumsiness or heaviness. Perhaps its most notable feature is the impressive head which is accentuated by a heavy beard and mustache. Although the practice of cropping both ears and tail are now mostly cosmetic, tails were originally docked to prevent injuries caused by herding and cart-pulling. The practice of cosmetic docking is currently opposed by the American Veterinary Medical Association.[4] In the area of origin (Flanders, Belgium) cropping was made illegal in 2006.[citation needed] The weight of males ranges from 80 to 120 pounds or 36 to 54 kilograms, slightly smaller for females.[citation needed] They are powerfully built, with a thick double coat, which can be fawn, black, grey brindle, or "pepper and salt" in color. Bouviers are sometimes considered non-shedding, but in fact do lose hair, like all dogs. Most of the hair that they lose is caught within the double coat which results in matting. They require weekly brushing and combing to maintain the coat. In addition to weekly brushing, the coat should be trimmed approximately every 3–5 weeks if it is to be a show dog. Trimming requires practice to achieve the proper look.
          <h5>Temperament</h5>
          Bouviers des Flandres are rational, gentle, loyal, and protective by nature. The breed's particular blend of characteristics makes them good family pets, as well as keen guard dogs. Unlike some animals bred for aggressive nature and power, the Bouvier possesses sophisticated traits, such as complex control, intelligence, and accountability.

          The Bouvier des Flandres is an obedient dog with a pleasant nature. They look intimidating, but are actually calm and gentle. They are enthusiastic, responsible, even-tempered, and fearless, and are excellent guard and watchdogs that are easy to train. This breed learns commands relatively fast. However, Bouviers get bored easily and learn best when repetition is limited.

          They require well-balanced training that remains consistent in nature. Without being harsh, it is important to consistently make the dog aware that the owner will remain the boss. This breed needs an experienced owner to prevent dominance and over-protectiveness problems. These dogs poorly trained can become inappropriately dominant towards humans. An un-socialized Bouvier can become fearful and pose a problem when introduced to new situations in which they do not feel comfortable.

          Bouviers should be socialized well, preferably starting at an early age, to avoid shyness, suspiciousness, and being overly reserved with strangers (although the breed is naturally aloof with strangers). Protection of the family when danger is present is not something that needs to be taught, nor is it something one can train out of them. The dog will rise to the occasion if needed. A good family dog, the Bouvier likes, and is excellent with, children. The Bouvier is very adaptable and goes about its business quietly and calmly. Obedience training starts when they are young. Their behavior depends on the owner's ability to communicate what is expected, and on the individual dominance level of the dog. They are usually good with other dogs if they are raised with them from puppyhood. Dominant individuals can be dog-aggressive if the owners are not assertive and do not communicate to the dog that fighting is unwanted. Slow to mature both in body and mind, the Bouvier does not fully mature until the age of 2–3 years.

         <h5>Description</h5>
         Tenterfield terriers must be predominantly white as required by he the Breed Standard of the ANKC. They are not exaggerated in any features. They have a square or compact body, a wedge shaped head with equal length from occiput to stop and stop to the end of the nose. This gives the head parallel head planes, making the head unusual in this Group. The Tenterfield Terrier may also have semi-erect ears or pricked ears, the latter being more common. Tenterfield Terriers stand around 28 cm (11 inches) high and can come in tan and white, black and white, liver/tan/white tri-coloured or black/tan/white tri-coloured.[1] Their unique feature is their naturally occurring bob tail which can come in any length.[2]

         <h5>Health</h5>
         Despite its small stature, the dog is friendly with an outgoing, adaptable nature, bold in the way of terriers and is intelligent. The coat is low maintenance for grooming purposes. Although they can live to 20 years in good health, the average lifespan is from 12 to 14 years.

           <h5>Description</h5>
           Tenterfield terriers must be predominantly white as required by he the Breed Standard of the ANKC. They are not exaggerated in any features. They have a square or compact body, a wedge shaped head with equal length from occiput to stop and stop to the end of the nose. This gives the head parallel head planes, making the head unusual in this Group. The Tenterfield Terrier may also have semi-erect ears or pricked ears, the latter being more common. Tenterfield Terriers stand around 28 cm (11 inches) high and can come in tan and white, black and white, liver/tan/white tri-coloured or black/tan/white tri-coloured.[1] Their unique feature is their naturally occurring bob tail which can come in any length.[2]

           <h5>Health</h5>
           Despite its small stature, the dog is friendly with an outgoing, adaptable nature, bold in the way of terriers and is intelligent. The coat is low maintenance for grooming purposes. Although they can live to 20 years in good health, the average lifespan is from 12 to 14 years.

            <h5>Description</h5>
            Tenterfield terriers must be predominantly white as required by he the Breed Standard of the ANKC. They are not exaggerated in any features. They have a square or compact body, a wedge shaped head with equal length from occiput to stop and stop to the end of the nose. This gives the head parallel head planes, making the head unusual in this Group. The Tenterfield Terrier may also have semi-erect ears or pricked ears, the latter being more common. Tenterfield Terriers stand around 28 cm (11 inches) high and can come in tan and white, black and white, liver/tan/white tri-coloured or black/tan/white tri-coloured.[1] Their unique feature is their naturally occurring bob tail which can come in any length.[2]
 
            <h5>Health</h5>
            Despite its small stature, the dog is friendly with an outgoing, adaptable nature, bold in the way of terriers and is intelligent. The coat is low maintenance for grooming purposes. Although they can live to 20 years in good health, the average lifespan is from 12 to 14 years.

          <h5>Description</h5>
          Tenterfield terriers must be predominantly white as required by he the Breed Standard of the ANKC. They are not exaggerated in any features. They have a square or compact body, a wedge shaped head with equal length from occiput to stop and stop to the end of the nose. This gives the head parallel head planes, making the head unusual in this Group. The Tenterfield Terrier may also have semi-erect ears or pricked ears, the latter being more common. Tenterfield Terriers stand around 28 cm (11 inches) high and can come in tan and white, black and white, liver/tan/white tri-coloured or black/tan/white tri-coloured.[1] Their unique feature is their naturally occurring bob tail which can come in any length.[2]

          <h5>Health</h5>
          Despite its small stature, the dog is friendly with an outgoing, adaptable nature, bold in the way of terriers and is intelligent. The coat is low maintenance for grooming purposes. Although they can live to 20 years in good health, the average lifespan is from 12 to 14 years.

         <h5>Description</h5>
         Tenterfield terriers must be predominantly white as required by he the Breed Standard of the ANKC. They are not exaggerated in any features. They have a square or compact body, a wedge shaped head with equal length from occiput to stop and stop to the end of the nose. This gives the head parallel head planes, making the head unusual in this Group. The Tenterfield Terrier may also have semi-erect ears or pricked ears, the latter being more common. Tenterfield Terriers stand around 28 cm (11 inches) high and can come in tan and white, black and white, liver/tan/white tri-coloured or black/tan/white tri-coloured.[1] Their unique feature is their naturally occurring bob tail which can come in any length.[2]

         <h5>Health</h5>
         Despite its small stature, the dog is friendly with an outgoing, adaptable nature, bold in the way of terriers and is intelligent. The coat is low maintenance for grooming purposes. Although they can live to 20 years in good health, the average lifespan is from 12 to 14 years.

         <h5>Description</h5>
         Tenterfield terriers must be predominantly white as required by he the Breed Standard of the ANKC. They are not exaggerated in any features. They have a square or compact body, a wedge shaped head with equal length from occiput to stop and stop to the end of the nose. This gives the head parallel head planes, making the head unusual in this Group. The Tenterfield Terrier may also have semi-erect ears or pricked ears, the latter being more common. Tenterfield Terriers stand around 28 cm (11 inches) high and can come in tan and white, black and white, liver/tan/white tri-coloured or black/tan/white tri-coloured.[1] Their unique feature is their naturally occurring bob tail which can come in any length.[2]

         <h5>Health</h5>
         Despite its small stature, the dog is friendly with an outgoing, adaptable nature, bold in the way of terriers and is intelligent. The coat is low maintenance for grooming purposes. Although they can live to 20 years in good health, the average lifespan is from 12 to 14 years.

        <h5>Description</h5>
        Pampas Deerhound (Portuguese: Veadeiro pampeano) is a Brazilian breed of hunting dog; it is also found in Argentina and Uruguay. It is common in Brazil, where it was first recognized by a national kennel club.[1] The dogs were used to track, capture, and hunt deer (pampas deer), and thus earned the name Pampas Deerhound (in Brazilian Portuguese "Veadeiro pampeano": veadeiro = deer-hound; pampeano = those who came from the pampas). It is still a widely preferred hunting companion to track other animals, such as wild boars.
        <h5>Appearance</h5>
        Medium-sized and long-legged with good muscles (denoting strength and hardiness), this dog breed is slender without seeming very thin and is physiologically built for speed.[3] The tail is carried low, with a length that does not exceed the hocks. Some dogs may have a small fringe towards the lower part of the tail.

The nose may be black, brown or liver colored, and the muzzle is the same length as the skull, with a not-too-marked stop. Its ears are pointed, bent backward (rose ears) and erect when alert. The eyes are greenish or hazel colored and could take on varying shades.[5]

           <h5>Description</h5>
           Pampas Deerhound (Portuguese: Veadeiro pampeano) is a Brazilian breed of hunting dog; it is also found in Argentina and Uruguay. It is common in Brazil, where it was first recognized by a national kennel club.[1] The dogs were used to track, capture, and hunt deer (pampas deer), and thus earned the name Pampas Deerhound (in Brazilian Portuguese "Veadeiro pampeano": veadeiro = deer-hound; pampeano = those who came from the pampas). It is still a widely preferred hunting companion to track other animals, such as wild boars.
           <h5>Appearance</h5>
           Medium-sized and long-legged with good muscles (denoting strength and hardiness), this dog breed is slender without seeming very thin and is physiologically built for speed.[3] The tail is carried low, with a length that does not exceed the hocks. Some dogs may have a small fringe towards the lower part of the tail.
   
   The nose may be black, brown or liver colored, and the muzzle is the same length as the skull, with a not-too-marked stop. Its ears are pointed, bent backward (rose ears) and erect when alert. The eyes are greenish or hazel colored and could take on varying shades.[5]

           Medium-sized and long-legged with good muscles (denoting strength and hardiness), this dog breed is slender without seeming very thin and is physiologically built for speed.[3] The tail is carried low, with a length that does not exceed the hocks. Some dogs may have a small fringe towards the lower part of the tail.
   
   The nose may be black, brown or liver colored, and the muzzle is the same length as the skull, with a not-too-marked stop. Its ears are pointed, bent backward (rose ears) and erect when alert. The eyes are greenish or hazel colored and could take on varying shades.[5]

        <h5>Description</h5>
        Pampas Deerhound (Portuguese: Veadeiro pampeano) is a Brazilian breed of hunting dog; it is also found in Argentina and Uruguay. It is common in Brazil, where it was first recognized by a national kennel club.[1] The dogs were used to track, capture, and hunt deer (pampas deer), and thus earned the name Pampas Deerhound (in Brazilian Portuguese "Veadeiro pampeano": veadeiro = deer-hound; pampeano = those who came from the pampas). It is still a widely preferred hunting companion to track other animals, such as wild boars.
        <h5>Appearance</h5>
        Medium-sized and long-legged with good muscles (denoting strength and hardiness), this dog breed is slender without seeming very thin and is physiologically built for speed.[3] The tail is carried low, with a length that does not exceed the hocks. Some dogs may have a small fringe towards the lower part of the tail.

The nose may be black, brown or liver colored, and the muzzle is the same length as the skull, with a not-too-marked stop. Its ears are pointed, bent backward (rose ears) and erect when alert. The eyes are greenish or hazel colored and could take on varying shades.[5]

It is common in Brazil, where it was first recognized by a national kennel club.[1] The dogs were used to track, capture, and hunt deer (pampas deer), and thus earned the name Pampas Deerhound (in Brazilian Portuguese "Veadeiro pampeano": veadeiro = deer-hound; pampeano = those who came from the pampas). It is still a widely preferred hunting companion to track other animals, such as wild boars.
           <h5>Appearance</h5>
           Medium-sized and long-legged with good muscles (denoting strength and hardiness), this dog breed is slender without seeming very thin and is physiologically built for speed.[3] The tail is carried low, with a length that does not exceed the hocks. Some dogs may have a small fringe towards the lower part of the tail.
   
   The nose may be black, brown or liver colored, and the muzzle is the same length as the skull, with a not-too-marked stop. Its ears are pointed, bent backward (rose ears) and erect when alert. The eyes are greenish or hazel colored and could take on varying shades.[5]

           <h5>Description</h5>
           Pampas Deerhound (Portuguese: Veadeiro pampeano) is a Brazilian breed of hunting dog; it is also found in Argentina and Uruguay. It is common in Brazil, where it was first recognized by a national kennel club.[1] The dogs were used to track, capture, and hunt deer (pampas deer), and thus earned the name Pampas Deerhound (in Brazilian Portuguese "Veadeiro pampeano": veadeiro = deer-hound; pampeano = those who came from the pampas). It is still a widely preferred hunting companion to track other animals, such as wild boars.
           <h5>Appearance</h5>
           Medium-sized and long-legged with good muscles (denoting strength and hardiness), this dog breed is slender without seeming very thin and is physiologically built for speed.[3] The tail is carried low, with a length that does not exceed the hocks. Some dogs may have a small fringe towards the lower part of the tail.
   
   The nose may be black, brown or liver colored, and the muzzle is the same length as the skull, with a not-too-marked stop. Its ears are pointed, bent backward (rose ears) and erect when alert. The eyes are greenish or hazel colored and could take on varying shades.[5]

          <h5>Description</h5>
          Pampas Deerhound (Portuguese: Veadeiro pampeano) is a Brazilian breed of hunting dog; it is also found in Argentina and Uruguay. It is common in Brazil, where it was first recognized by a national kennel club.[1] The dogs were used to track, capture, and hunt deer (pampas deer), and thus earned the name Pampas Deerhound (in Brazilian Portuguese "Veadeiro pampeano": veadeiro = deer-hound; pampeano = those who came from the pampas). It is still a widely preferred hunting companion to track other animals, such as wild boars.
          <h5>Appearance</h5>
          Medium-sized and long-legged with good muscles (denoting strength and hardiness), this dog breed is slender without seeming very thin and is physiologically built for speed.[3] The tail is carried low, with a length that does not exceed the hocks. Some dogs may have a small fringe towards the lower part of the tail.
  
  The nose may be black, brown or liver colored, and the muzzle is the same length as the skull, with a not-too-marked stop. Its ears are pointed, bent backward (rose ears) and erect when alert. The eyes are greenish or hazel colored and could take on varying shades.[5]

          <h5>Description</h5>
          Pampas Deerhound (Portuguese: Veadeiro pampeano) is a Brazilian breed of hunting dog; it is also found in Argentina and Uruguay. It is common in Brazil, where it was first recognized by a national kennel club.[1] The dogs were used to track, capture, and hunt deer (pampas deer), and thus earned the name Pampas Deerhound (in Brazilian Portuguese "Veadeiro pampeano": veadeiro = deer-hound; pampeano = those who came from the pampas). It is still a widely preferred hunting companion to track other animals, such as wild boars.
          <h5>Appearance</h5>
          Medium-sized and long-legged with good muscles (denoting strength and hardiness), this dog breed is slender without seeming very thin and is physiologically built for speed.[3] The tail is carried low, with a length that does not exceed the hocks. Some dogs may have a small fringe towards the lower part of the tail.
  
  The nose may be black, brown or liver colored, and the muzzle is the same length as the skull, with a not-too-marked stop. Its ears are pointed, bent backward (rose ears) and erect when alert. The eyes are greenish or hazel colored and could take on varying shades.[5]

It is common in Brazil, where it was first recognized by a national kennel club.[1] The dogs were used to track, capture, and hunt deer (pampas deer), and thus earned the name Pampas Deerhound (in Brazilian Portuguese "Veadeiro pampeano": veadeiro = deer-hound; pampeano = those who came from the pampas). It is still a widely preferred hunting companion to track other animals, such as wild boars.
           <h5>Appearance</h5>
           Medium-sized and long-legged with good muscles (denoting strength and hardiness), this dog breed is slender without seeming very thin and is physiologically built for speed.[3] The tail is carried low, with a length that does not exceed the hocks. Some dogs may have a small fringe towards the lower part of the tail.
   
   The nose may be black, brown or liver colored, and the muzzle is the same length as the skull, with a not-too-marked stop. Its ears are pointed, bent backward (rose ears) and erect when alert. The eyes are greenish or hazel colored and could take on varying shades.[5]

          <h5>Description</h5>
          Pampas Deerhound (Portuguese: Veadeiro pampeano) is a Brazilian breed of hunting dog; it is also found in Argentina and Uruguay. It is common in Brazil, where it was first recognized by a national kennel club.[1] The dogs were used to track, capture, and hunt deer (pampas deer), and thus earned the name Pampas Deerhound (in Brazilian Portuguese "Veadeiro pampeano": veadeiro = deer-hound; pampeano = those who came from the pampas). It is still a widely preferred hunting companion to track other animals, such as wild boars.
          <h5>Appearance</h5>
          Medium-sized and long-legged with good muscles (denoting strength and hardiness), this dog breed is slender without seeming very thin and is physiologically built for speed.[3] The tail is carried low, with a length that does not exceed the hocks. Some dogs may have a small fringe towards the lower part of the tail.
  
  The nose may be black, brown or liver colored, and the muzzle is the same length as the skull, with a not-too-marked stop. Its ears are pointed, bent backward (rose ears) and erect when alert. The eyes are greenish or hazel colored and could take on varying shades.[5]

           <h5>Description</h5>
           Pampas Deerhound (Portuguese: Veadeiro pampeano) is a Brazilian breed of hunting dog; it is also found in Argentina and Uruguay. It is common in Brazil, where it was first recognized by a national kennel club.[1] The dogs were used to track, capture, and hunt deer (pampas deer), and thus earned the name Pampas Deerhound (in Brazilian Portuguese "Veadeiro pampeano": veadeiro = deer-hound; pampeano = those who came from the pampas). It is still a widely preferred hunting companion to track other animals, such as wild boars.
           <h5>Appearance</h5>
           Medium-sized and long-legged with good muscles (denoting strength and hardiness), this dog breed is slender without seeming very thin and is physiologically built for speed.[3] The tail is carried low, with a length that does not exceed the hocks. Some dogs may have a small fringe towards the lower part of the tail.
   
   The nose may be black, brown or liver colored, and the muzzle is the same length as the skull, with a not-too-marked stop. Its ears are pointed, bent backward (rose ears) and erect when alert. The eyes are greenish or hazel colored and could take on varying shades.[5]

  The nose may be black, brown or liver colored, and the muzzle is the same length as the skull, with a not-too-marked stop. Its ears are pointed, bent backward (rose ears) and erect when alert. The eyes are greenish or hazel colored and could take on varying shades.[5]

           <h5>Description</h5>
           Pampas Deerhound (Portuguese: Veadeiro pampeano) is a Brazilian breed of hunting dog; it is also found in Argentina and Uruguay. It is common in Brazil, where it was first recognized by a national kennel club.[1] The dogs were used to track, capture, and hunt deer (pampas deer), and thus earned the name Pampas Deerhound (in Brazilian Portuguese "Veadeiro pampeano": veadeiro = deer-hound; pampeano = those who came from the pampas). It is still a widely preferred hunting companion to track other animals, such as wild boars.
           <h5>Appearance</h5>
           Medium-sized and long-legged with good muscles (denoting strength and hardiness), this dog breed is slender without seeming very thin and is physiologically built for speed.[3] The tail is carried low, with a length that does not exceed the hocks. Some dogs may have a small fringe towards the lower part of the tail.
   
   The nose may be black, brown or liver colored, and the muzzle is the same length as the skull, with a not-too-marked stop. Its ears are pointed, bent backward (rose ears) and erect when alert. The eyes are greenish or hazel colored and could take on varying shades.[5]

          <h5>Description</h5>
          Pampas Deerhound (Portuguese: Veadeiro pampeano) is a Brazilian breed of hunting dog; it is also found in Argentina and Uruguay. It is common in Brazil, where it was first recognized by a national kennel club.[1] The dogs were used to track, capture, and hunt deer (pampas deer), and thus earned the name Pampas Deerhound (in Brazilian Portuguese "Veadeiro pampeano": veadeiro = deer-hound; pampeano = those who came from the pampas). It is still a widely preferred hunting companion to track other animals, such as wild boars.
          <h5>Appearance</h5>
          Medium-sized and long-legged with good muscles (denoting strength and hardiness), this dog breed is slender without seeming very thin and is physiologically built for speed.[3] The tail is carried low, with a length that does not exceed the hocks. Some dogs may have a small fringe towards the lower part of the tail.
  
  The nose may be black, brown or liver colored, and the muzzle is the same length as the skull, with a not-too-marked stop. Its ears are pointed, bent backward (rose ears) and erect when alert. The eyes are greenish or hazel colored and could take on varying shades.[5]

          <h5>Description</h5>
          Pampas Deerhound (Portuguese: Veadeiro pampeano) is a Brazilian breed of hunting dog; it is also found in Argentina and Uruguay. It is common in Brazil, where it was first recognized by a national kennel club.[1] The dogs were used to track, capture, and hunt deer (pampas deer), and thus earned the name Pampas Deerhound (in Brazilian Portuguese "Veadeiro pampeano": veadeiro = deer-hound; pampeano = those who came from the pampas). It is still a widely preferred hunting companion to track other animals, such as wild boars.
          <h5>Appearance</h5>
          Medium-sized and long-legged with good muscles (denoting strength and hardiness), this dog breed is slender without seeming very thin and is physiologically built for speed.[3] The tail is carried low, with a length that does not exceed the hocks. Some dogs may have a small fringe towards the lower part of the tail.
  
  The nose may be black, brown or liver colored, and the muzzle is the same length as the skull, with a not-too-marked stop. Its ears are pointed, bent backward (rose ears) and erect when alert. The eyes are greenish or hazel colored and could take on varying shades.[5]

           <h5>Description</h5>
           Pampas Deerhound (Portuguese: Veadeiro pampeano) is a Brazilian breed of hunting dog; it is also found in Argentina and Uruguay. It is common in Brazil, where it was first recognized by a national kennel club.[1] The dogs were used to track, capture, and hunt deer (pampas deer), and thus earned the name Pampas Deerhound (in Brazilian Portuguese "Veadeiro pampeano": veadeiro = deer-hound; pampeano = those who came from the pampas). It is still a widely preferred hunting companion to track other animals, such as wild boars.
           <h5>Appearance</h5>
           Medium-sized and long-legged with good muscles (denoting strength and hardiness), this dog breed is slender without seeming very thin and is physiologically built for speed.[3] The tail is carried low, with a length that does not exceed the hocks. Some dogs may have a small fringe towards the lower part of the tail.
   
   The nose may be black, brown or liver colored, and the muzzle is the same length as the skull, with a not-too-marked stop. Its ears are pointed, bent backward (rose ears) and erect when alert. The eyes are greenish or hazel colored and could take on varying shades.[5]

           <h5>Description</h5>
           Pampas Deerhound (Portuguese: Veadeiro pampeano) is a Brazilian breed of hunting dog; it is also found in Argentina and Uruguay. It is common in Brazil, where it was first recognized by a national kennel club.[1] The dogs were used to track, capture, and hunt deer (pampas deer), and thus earned the name Pampas Deerhound (in Brazilian Portuguese "Veadeiro pampeano": veadeiro = deer-hound; pampeano = those who came from the pampas). It is still a widely preferred hunting companion to track other animals, such as wild boars.
           <h5>Appearance</h5>
           Medium-sized and long-legged with good muscles (denoting strength and hardiness), this dog breed is slender without seeming very thin and is physiologically built for speed.[3] The tail is carried low, with a length that does not exceed the hocks. Some dogs may have a small fringe towards the lower part of the tail.
   
   The nose may be black, brown or liver colored, and the muzzle is the same length as the skull, with a not-too-marked stop. Its ears are pointed, bent backward (rose ears) and erect when alert. The eyes are greenish or hazel colored and could take on varying shades.[5]

           <h5>Description</h5>
           Pampas Deerhound (Portuguese: Veadeiro pampeano) is a Brazilian breed of hunting dog; it is also found in Argentina and Uruguay. It is common in Brazil, where it was first recognized by a national kennel club.[1] The dogs were used to track, capture, and hunt deer (pampas deer), and thus earned the name Pampas Deerhound (in Brazilian Portuguese "Veadeiro pampeano": veadeiro = deer-hound; pampeano = those who came from the pampas). It is still a widely preferred hunting companion to track other animals, such as wild boars.
           <h5>Appearance</h5>
           Medium-sized and long-legged with good muscles (denoting strength and hardiness), this dog breed is slender without seeming very thin and is physiologically built for speed.[3] The tail is carried low, with a length that does not exceed the hocks. Some dogs may have a small fringe towards the lower part of the tail.
   
   The nose may be black, brown or liver colored, and the muzzle is the same length as the skull, with a not-too-marked stop. Its ears are pointed, bent backward (rose ears) and erect when alert. The eyes are greenish or hazel colored and could take on varying shades.[5]

          <h5>Description</h5>
          Pampas Deerhound (Portuguese: Veadeiro pampeano) is a Brazilian breed of hunting dog; it is also found in Argentina and Uruguay. It is common in Brazil, where it was first recognized by a national kennel club.[1] The dogs were used to track, capture, and hunt deer (pampas deer), and thus earned the name Pampas Deerhound (in Brazilian Portuguese "Veadeiro pampeano": veadeiro = deer-hound; pampeano = those who came from the pampas). It is still a widely preferred hunting companion to track other animals, such as wild boars.
          <h5>Appearance</h5>
          Medium-sized and long-legged with good muscles (denoting strength and hardiness), this dog breed is slender without seeming very thin and is physiologically built for speed.[3] The tail is carried low, with a length that does not exceed the hocks. Some dogs may have a small fringe towards the lower part of the tail.
  
  The nose may be black, brown or liver colored, and the muzzle is the same length as the skull, with a not-too-marked stop. Its ears are pointed, bent backward (rose ears) and erect when alert. The eyes are greenish or hazel colored and could take on varying shades.[5]

          <h5>Description</h5>
          Pampas Deerhound (Portuguese: Veadeiro pampeano) is a Brazilian breed of hunting dog; it is also found in Argentina and Uruguay. It is common in Brazil, where it was first recognized by a national kennel club.[1] The dogs were used to track, capture, and hunt deer (pampas deer), and thus earned the name Pampas Deerhound (in Brazilian Portuguese "Veadeiro pampeano": veadeiro = deer-hound; pampeano = those who came from the pampas). It is still a widely preferred hunting companion to track other animals, such as wild boars.
          <h5>Appearance</h5>
          Medium-sized and long-legged with good muscles (denoting strength and hardiness), this dog breed is slender without seeming very thin and is physiologically built for speed.[3] The tail is carried low, with a length that does not exceed the hocks. Some dogs may have a small fringe towards the lower part of the tail.
  
  The nose may be black, brown or liver colored, and the muzzle is the same length as the skull, with a not-too-marked stop. Its ears are pointed, bent backward (rose ears) and erect when alert. The eyes are greenish or hazel colored and could take on varying shades.[5]

          <h5>Description</h5>
          Pampas Deerhound (Portuguese: Veadeiro pampeano) is a Brazilian breed of hunting dog; it is also found in Argentina and Uruguay. It is common in Brazil, where it was first recognized by a national kennel club.[1] The dogs were used to track, capture, and hunt deer (pampas deer), and thus earned the name Pampas Deerhound (in Brazilian Portuguese "Veadeiro pampeano": veadeiro = deer-hound; pampeano = those who came from the pampas). It is still a widely preferred hunting companion to track other animals, such as wild boars.
          <h5>Appearance</h5>
          Medium-sized and long-legged with good muscles (denoting strength and hardiness), this dog breed is slender without seeming very thin and is physiologically built for speed.[3] The tail is carried low, with a length that does not exceed the hocks. Some dogs may have a small fringe towards the lower part of the tail.
  
  The nose may be black, brown or liver colored, and the muzzle is the same length as the skull, with a not-too-marked stop. Its ears are pointed, bent backward (rose ears) and erect when alert. The eyes are greenish or hazel colored and could take on varying shades.[5]

           Pampas Deerhound (Portuguese: Veadeiro pampeano) is a Brazilian breed of hunting dog; it is also found in Argentina and Uruguay. It is common in Brazil, where it was first recognized by a national kennel club.[1] The dogs were used to track, capture, and hunt deer (pampas deer), and thus earned the name Pampas Deerhound (in Brazilian Portuguese "Veadeiro pampeano": veadeiro = deer-hound; pampeano = those who came from the pampas). It is still a widely preferred hunting companion to track other animals, such as wild boars.
           <h5>Appearance</h5>
           Medium-sized and long-legged with good muscles (denoting strength and hardiness), this dog breed is slender without seeming very thin and is physiologically built for speed.[3] The tail is carried low, with a length that does not exceed the hocks. Some dogs may have a small fringe towards the lower part of the tail.
   
   The nose may be black, brown or liver colored, and the muzzle is the same length as the skull, with a not-too-marked stop. Its ears are pointed, bent backward (rose ears) and erect when alert. The eyes are greenish or hazel colored and could take on varying shades.[5]

           <h5>Description</h5>
           Pampas Deerhound (Portuguese: Veadeiro pampeano) is a Brazilian breed of hunting dog; it is also found in Argentina and Uruguay. It is common in Brazil, where it was first recognized by a national kennel club.[1] The dogs were used to track, capture, and hunt deer (pampas deer), and thus earned the name Pampas Deerhound (in Brazilian Portuguese "Veadeiro pampeano": veadeiro = deer-hound; pampeano = those who came from the pampas). It is still a widely preferred hunting companion to track other animals, such as wild boars.
           <h5>Appearance</h5>
           Medium-sized and long-legged with good muscles (denoting strength and hardiness), this dog breed is slender without seeming very thin and is physiologically built for speed.[3] The tail is carried low, with a length that does not exceed the hocks. Some dogs may have a small fringe towards the lower part of the tail.
   
   The nose may be black, brown or liver colored, and the muzzle is the same length as the skull, with a not-too-marked stop. Its ears are pointed, bent backward (rose ears) and erect when alert. The eyes are greenish or hazel colored and could take on varying shades.[5]
